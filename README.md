# AdobeXDProjects
This repository contains the Adobe XD projects I have worked on. It contains both collaborative and independents projects. 
This repository has a folder structure as follows:
For Project 1:
## Title: 
Mastodon Market Place
## Decription:
It was a university community based, online free market place. In short it was a 'Craig's List' available only to Purdue Students. The accounts are verified at the beginning and end of every semester, to update the list of students enrolled to Purdue University.
